# tradingview_bullrun_indicator
The Bullrun indicator calculate live from on Chain and different other sources at what point we are currently in the Bitcoin Cycle.

Each signal can be turned off individually.
The indicator can also be used for every altcoin listed on Tradingview. Notice that some signal will be turned automaticly off, while you are using an altcoin chart. These Indicators pull OnChain data from the BTC Network and have no direct use for Altcoins.

The bullrun indicator gives a percentage value that is easy to interpret and is easy to use.
A green color represents a good oppertunity to buy.
red color represents a stage for taking profit.
the background becomes more intense with multiple signals. So the more intense the color is shown more signals are inline with each other and the signals become more powerful. And the proporbility is increasing for bull run or sell off on a Macro Scale.
hints to the signals are displayed to ensure an easy interpretation of the signals.
